         <textarea rows=30 cols=50> You are in a bookstore. There, on a shelf, a cheap paper back thriller catches your attention. You lift it up and see that is called " Drug Lord Down". Curious and slighty board, you open up the book to a random page, only to discover that your name, Carlos Lucus Forerunner, is in the book. You also realize that the book is through the police's view, and that you are the antagonist. Shocked, you read on, on to discover that he is, like you, a drug smuggler that belongs to the gang. THe Pitbulls. He is also being chased by the Dark City Police and his wife was murdered by a rival gang member, just like you. You buy the book and look at the spine. The book was published by a company called Sinso and you realize that your only chance is to get to Sinso.
